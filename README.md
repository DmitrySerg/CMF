# Option Pricing
It`s all about money

This is the project of CMF aimed on building a fully-functional algotrading platform. For now it`s just an app, where I implemented 4 basic option-pricing models: Black-Scholes, Binomial, Trinomial and Explicit Finite Differences. Everything is wrapped into a tkinter GUI.
